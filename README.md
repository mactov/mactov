- 👋 Hi, I’m @mactov
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things! The main are: C, python, rust, Linux, system programming, code generation, API, and blockchain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on system programming projects. I just started an open source project trying to make Linux simpler to install and use for non-geeks.
